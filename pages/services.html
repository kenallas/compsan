    <h3>Below are my services:</h3>
        <h5>
        Does the slowness of your computer irritate you immensely:
        Then, after a phone call or an e-mail, your laptop or desktop 
        software and / or hardware is moderately cleaned by a freelancer
        so that all those excess cookies and system files are deleted and
        it becomes almost as fast as when you had just bought it.
        If you have multiple computers, call Kenneth from Keceweb Services and we 
        can then see what the possibilities are for you at home for a centralized 
        network so that you can enjoy optimal user convenience. For a small fee I will 
        build a server for you, install the server software and connect all those 
        computers or laptops to this server.
        If you are tired of all those cables that run to your router and you want 
        to switch to a wireless network, then I can take care of Keceweb Services 
        that you can store all those cables in no time at a reasonable price.                                
        I can also make that PC faster by upgrading from a desktop computer. 
        With desktop computers, I can also speed up the hard drive by applying a 
        technique called RAID-0. There are extra costs associated with this by 
        purchasing an extra hard disk or disks (á ~€ 70, -). It just depends on your 
        wishes.
