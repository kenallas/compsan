    <h5>Does the slowness of your computer also irritate you immensely? Then na
        one phone call or an email your laptop or desktop software - and/or
        hardware cleaned by me so all those excess cookies and
        system files are removed and it is fast again.Nowadays every
        pc; whether it is a laptop, desktop or tablet system, antivirus software is required.
        CSAN recommends the following antivirus software:
        Microsoft Security Essentials for the somewhat quiet surfers
        AVG Antivirus for the heavier surfers
        Antivirus software should in principle also be set to your own needs
        and use. I'll ask you a few questions, do a little analysis, and ask your
        antivirus software in such a way that your laptop or desktop is less at risk of
        a virus. Because experience shows that the virus definitions are sometimes never updated
        and that a scan never takes place, this software must be set up.
        Do you recognize yourself in this situation and is your computer running a virus again and again
        on? Call Keceweb Services now or send me an e-mail.</h5>

        If you have several computers, call Kenneth from csan now, and we will immediately look at the possibilities for your home for a centralized network so that you can also enjoy optimal user convenience. I will build a custom server for you and install the server software for it. I also connect all those computers and/or laptops to this central server, so that you can work from a central location. That central server usually has the largest hard drive size of all network components and can also be set up to automatically back up all client computers.
        With regular customers, computer problems can also be solved remotely. That depends on the wishes of you as the customer.
Information such as holiday photos, films and other important documents are indispensable in this day and age. That is why it is also important to backup these regularly through a handy backup system that I, as a freelancer of Keceweb Services, can also take care of. I supply the necessary software and the storage module and within no time a seamless backup system is arranged for you and that for a fixed low price.
There is also an online backup system that provides even more options. Apart from the regular desktops and laptops, android and iPhone devices can also use this: IDrive. Call or email Keceweb Services for more information about this backup system so that I can install this system for you as a freelancer.
Nowadays every PC has; if it's a laptop, desktop or tablet system, antivirus software is needed.
Keceweb Services recommends the following type of antivirus software:
Microsoft Security Essentials for calm surfers
AVG Antivirus for the heavier surfers
Antivirus software should in principle also be set to your use. I'll ask you a few questions, do a little analysis, and set up your antivirus software in such a way that your laptop or desktop is less at risk from a virus. Because experience shows that the virus definitions are sometimes never updated nor that a scan ever takes place, this software must be set up.
Do you recognize yourself in this situation and your computer keeps getting a virus: call Keceweb Services or send an e-mail!
